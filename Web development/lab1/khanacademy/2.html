        Nobody’s born <strong>smart</strong>. We all start at <strong>0</strong>. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do <strong>algebra</strong>.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to <strong>10</strong>.<br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his <strong>ABCs</strong> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to <strong>learn</strong>.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you <strong>walk</strong>.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger</strong>.<br>
        Failing is just another word for <strong>growing</strong>. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. <em>learning</em>.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <em>yet</em>.<br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can <strong>learn</strong> anything.

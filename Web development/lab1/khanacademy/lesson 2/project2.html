        <h1>Travel to Seychelles Island</h1>

         <p id = "island">Off the coast of eastern Africa near Tanzania, The Seychelles are an archipelago of 115 islands that lie in the Indian Ocean. The islands are known for having some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, even fit for royalty, as Prince William and Kate Middleton spent their honeymoon there. Ian Fleming, the famed author of the James Bond novels, even visited the Seychelles for writing inspiration, and many popular blockbuster films, like Castaway and Tarzan, have been shot here.</p>
         <p>Although the traveling journey to the Seychelles is long, the pristine beaches, unspoiled nature, and unique creole culture make the rest of the world melt away and allow you to truly enjoy your vacation.</p>
